### **Neural integration for constitutive equations â€“ HANDS-ON for experimental data**  

This repository contains **Jupyter notebooks** and **code** developed for the **2025 ALERT Olek Zienkiewicz Doctoral School** on *Constitutive modelling of geomaterials* - Session: *Constitutive modelling meets Machine Learning*.

#### **ðŸ“‚ Hands-on Exercises**
Two exercises are considered, both uses experimental results of a sand specimen subjected to drained triaxial compression from [SoilModels](https://soilmodels.com/). The first exercise considers a filtered (smoothed) version of the original dataset, the second uses the original, raw dataset. The filtered data is used to enable a fast training which can be effectively used to vary the structure of the network (and its hyper-parameters).


#### **I. Learning constitutive equations from experiments â€“ `[sand] training & validation`**
- *Material*: Sand with scattered gravel *(origin: Dobrany, Czech Republic)*
- *Tests*: Drained triaxial compression  
- *Dataset*: *Smoothed version* of the experimental data  

#### **II. Learning constitutive equations from experiments â€“ `[sand-raw] training & validation`**
- *Material*: Sand with scattered gravel *(origin: Dobrany, Czech Republic)*
- *Tests*: Drained triaxial compression  
- *Dataset*: *Original experimental data*
